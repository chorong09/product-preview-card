## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

how to apply web fonts

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:opsz,wght@9..144,700&family=Montserrat:wght@500;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
}
```

how to center content on the screen

```css
.make-center-css {
  display:flex; 
  justify-content:center; 
  align-items:center;
}
```

how to vertically align text
```css
.vertically-aligh-text {
  vertical-align: super
}
```


### Continued development

There is a subtle difference between the reference and what I created. I will make efforts to minimize this difference.
